Use this for reference, please do not copy. TA will find out if you copy so for your own good, do not.


Definiton for Geospatial Vision:
Geospatial visualization or geovisualization (also referred to as geographic visualization) is the use of geospatial visualization tools and techniques for the analysis of geospatial data. Geospatial data visualization is a constructive practice that integrates interactive visualization into traditional maps, allowing the ability to explore different layers of a map, zoom in and out, change the visual appearance of the map, and relate a variety of factors to the geographic area. Geospatial modeling uses advanced cartographic technologies allowing analysts to visualize geospatial data, spanning industries such as urban planning, transportation, and investment management.
